# 📘 My Open Source Tech Books

> “Knowledge grows when shared.”

Welcome to my personal collection of **open-source technical books**.  
This repository is a living library where I publish books I write while learning and practicing technology.

## 🎯 My Goal

- 🧠 Create a **second brain** for myself  
- 🌍 Share knowledge **freely** with anyone who wants to learn  
- 📚 Build clear, beginner-friendly resources without unnecessary complexity  

All books here are **free, open source**, and written with care.

## 🧠 Why I Created These Books

I believe the best way to truly learn something is to **write it down in your own words**.

These books are:
- Not copied documentation  
- Not rushed tutorials  
- Not overly theoretical  

They are written to answer one question at a time:

> *“What is this, why does it exist, and how do I use it safely?”*

This makes them perfect as a **second brain** — for me and for anyone else.
